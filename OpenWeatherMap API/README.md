# OpenWeatherMap API
# Project:
A python program that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to collect and present weather information for any city in the U.S. The program accepts either ZIP Codes or cities as inputs, 
and allows for the temperature data to be presented in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, or Celsius.

# How to Use:
Simply download the file and input your personal API code where indicated at the beginning of the program.


# License:
My program is free to use as desired, though please cite me if using it. The interactions with the OpenWeatherMap API depend upon your personal account with OpenWeatherMap and their terms of service.
