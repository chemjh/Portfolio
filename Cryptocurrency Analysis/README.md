# Cryptocurrency Analysis

# Project: 
Using historical data for many cryptocurrencies ranging from the years 2013 to 2018, I conduct an in-depth analysis on the top 10 crytpocurrencies by market capitalization. This project contains:
- Extensive visualizations of various cryptocurrency metrics using matplotlib.
- Feature creation to faciliate a meaningful analysis of the various attributes and characterstics of the top 10 cryptocurrencies

# How to Use:
Simply run the notebook with the associated data in its working directory.

# Data:
The data used for this project was submitted to Kaggle by jvent, and is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessevent/all-crypto-currencies.
This was one of my earlier projects, and so I did not realize that he had not provided his sources for this data. While that might ordinarily be a problem, the data 
worked for my purposes and all of it is publicly available cryptocurrency blockchain information so there are no issues of copyright.

# License:
My work is free to use, though please cite the appropriate parties if using their data. The cryptocurrency data is all publicly available information.
