# Analysis of Fiat Currency Data Scraped from the Federal Reserve Website

# Project: 
Examining data I scrape from the Federal Reserve website, I find and visualize interesting properties of the various national fiat currencies as well as their relationships to each other. I rely on Beautiful Soup to parse the website, and then collect the data I wish to examine and manipulate into a dataframe using Pandas.

# How to Use:
Simply run the file, though expect that my analysis may not be entirely accurate any longer given that the data being analyzed is website data subject to change. My analysis is entered into the document for the data I examined when I initially made this program, however the data will be as recent as the Federal Reserve keeps it on their website. As a result, this notebook will produce up-to-date results, whereas my the particulars of my analysis are likely to be at least somewhat dated.

# Data:
