# Covid-19 and Crime in New York City

# Project: 
Did the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns have any effect on, or relationship with, crime in New York City? Examining both Covid-19 cases and deaths, as well as various categories of crimes in New York city broadly and by borough, I explore the data for emergent relatinships using: 
-	data visualization and exploration via barcharts, line plots, and combinations thereof
-	feature correlation assessment using Kendall's Tau
-	creation of time-series model via ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

The .Rmd file is present should you wish to run the project yourself, but if you would like to see the results of the project, including visualizations, I've included a pdf of the project that shows all the cell outputs.
