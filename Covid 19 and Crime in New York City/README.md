# Covid 19 and Crime in New York City

# Project: 
Did the Covid 19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns have any effect on, or relationship with, crime in New York City? Examining both Covid 19 cases and deaths, as well as various categories of crimes in New York city broadly and by borough, I explore the data for emergent relatinships: 
-	data visualization and exploration via histograms and boxplots
-	feature selection using RFECV
-	correction of strong data imbalances using random undersampling and SMOTE
-	random forest classifier model training and optimization using grid searches with cross validation
-	model assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC visualization

# How to Use:
Simply download the notebook and the associated data, and copy and paste the appropriate path on your machine for the location of the data into the initial data read. 
 The notebook should then run appropriately.
