# Movie Recommender

# Project: 
Wouldn't it be great to know which movie you should watch next? Using data from the MovieLens dataset, I've created a movie recommender model that works off of correlations between movies and their reviews.
By inputting a movie into the model a collection of similar movies will be returned in a pleasing format.

# How to Use:
Simply run the notebook with its associated data in the working directory. 

# Data:
The data used for this project was submitted to Kaggle by fedesoriano, and was collected by him from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, located here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction.
