# Portfolio
Hello, I'm John Herrick. 
I'm presently undergoing my final quarter at Bellevue University in the pursuit of my MS in Data Science. This a portfolio of my work so far, with works such as:
- python programming to request up to the moment weather data for any city in the United States
- an analysis of the relationship between COVID-19 and crime rats in New York City
- natural language processing of large collections of Amazon book reviews
- quantitative analysis of cryptocurrencies and their relationship with fiat currencies and their rates of change in value
- prediction of firm bankruptcies based on quantitative economic data pertaining to said firms 

There's more than that, but why don't you peruse my portfolio to see what I can do?
