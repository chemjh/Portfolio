# Portfolio
Hello, I'm John Herrick. 
I have a Master of Science degree in Data Science from Bellevue University, and this a portfolio of my work. My projects include:
- python programming to request up to the moment weather data for any city in the United States
- an analysis of the relationship between COVID-19 and crime rates in New York City
- natural language processing of large collections of Amazon book reviews
- quantitative analysis of cryptocurrencies and their relationship with fiat currencies and their rates of change in value
- prediction of firm bankruptcies based on quantitative economic data pertaining to said firms
- and more!

Please take a moment to look around and see what I can do.
