# Portfolio
Hello, I'm John Herrick. 
I'm presently undergoing my final quarter at Bellevue University in the pursuit of my MS in Data Science. This a portfolio of my work so far, ranging from complex python programming to request up to the moment weather data for any city in the United States, to the analysis of the relationship between COVID-19 and crime rats in New York City, to natural language processing of large collections of Amazon book reviews, to the quantitative analysis of cryptocurrencies and their relationship with fiat currencies and their rates of change in value, to the prediction of firm bankruptcies based on quantitative economic data pertaining to said firms. 

There's more than that, but why don't you peruse my portfolio to see what I can do?
