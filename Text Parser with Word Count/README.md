# Text Parser with Word Count

# Project: 
This Python program parses a text document (a portion of the Gettysburg Address) and collects the unique words therein into a dictionary. It then returns a pleasingly formatted
output of the unique words in the text alongside their frequency of occurence in descending order.

# How to Use:
Simply run the file with its associated gettysburg.txt file in the working directory. If you like, trade in a text of your choosing by altering the path of the initial data read to your preferred text file.

# Data:
The data in this project is from the Gettysburg Address and is in the public domain.
