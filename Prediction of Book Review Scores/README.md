# Prediction Book Review Scores from Text

# Project: 
Economic ruin or great financial success? Obviously we all prefer one over the other, but both will exist in our society as long as we have markets. Wouldn’t it be great to see financial ruin coming? To know of its impending arrival when there was still a chance to avert it? My project seeks to make this at least somewhat a reality by predicting bankruptcy among Taiwanese firms based on quantitative economic data.
This project contains: 
-	data visualization and exploration via histograms and boxplots
-	feature selection using RFECV
-	correction of strong data imbalances using random undersampling and SMOTE
-	random forest classifier model training and optimization using grid searches with cross validation
-	model assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC visualization

# How to Use:
Simply download the notebook and the associated data, and copy and paste the appropriate path on your machine for the location of the data into the initial data read. 
 The notebook should then run appropriately.

# Data:
